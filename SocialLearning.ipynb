It can be used for testing high-voltage batteries as well as simulating high-voltage batteries while testing hybrid vehicle drivelines and inverter systems. The High Voltage Battery Test System is fully line regenerative, resulting in a very power efficient unit, minimizing electricity usage, lowering operating costs, and providing an extremely environmentally friendly profile.\n",

        " The Small Engine Dynamometer was developed specifically to meet the needs of small engine manufacturers who must now comply with engine testing procedures required by emission standards contained in 40 CFR Part 1065. This innovative machine can test both steady state and transient emissions cycles, and allows users to avoid the issues associated with larger dynamometers, such as breaking of driveshafts or couplings.\n",
